Files in this directory are examples on how to include various functions when initializing your bot. 
They should be treated as separate bot initializations and therefore, make sure to include what you want in a single 'main.py' that's located in the root dir if multiple are needed.
As it stands at the time of this writing (Jan. 15, 2023), the main.py in this repo only includes 'load cogs'.
